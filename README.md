Trumprogger: An Arcade Game Clone
===============================

## Getting started

First, clone or download the repo to your local machine. Once downloaded, launch the <em>index.html</em> file in your preferred browser. 

You may notice an initial load time of a couple of seconds depending on your internet connection speed; I'm working on expanding the cache code (Resources.js) for use with the audio files. 

For a live demo, check out [my site](http://jasonmwhite.com/trumphrogger/index.html). 

## The Goal

Get President Trumphrogger to safety through a throng of fake-news reporters! Can he make it to across the very sparse Washington Mall, where there's obviously fewer people than some might say? If the reporters get him, they'll uncover more secrets and decrease his net worth, which the president totally wants to avoid. However! He'll also happen upon his favorite dietary mainstays—KFC and Diet Coke—and his questionable pastime, Twitter. Collecting these treats will increase the president's net worth, so be sure to satisfy each of his base desires and prove how firmly you wish to Make America Gastrointestinally Anemic Again!

## Game Operation

This is a simple, keyboard-based HTML5 canvas game that uses directional keys to move President Trumphrogger across the board. As you collect treats, the president's net worth goes up. As you collide with reporters, his net worth goes down. Note they both increment either way by $130,000. After each hit, 1 of the resident Putins will depart the stage -- as soon as Putin has left Trumphrogger stranded on the Washington Mall, it's Game Over!

## Dependencies

This project is only dependent on your willingness to play it. 

## Special Thanks

Immense appreciation goes to my cohort for their encouragement while I worked on this proof-of-concept product. I'd also like to thank the countless blogs I found across the interwebs, not all of which helped answer my most pressing #*&^! questions. 

You may notice that I went ES6-class stupid while writing this game. I, in fact, unabashedly did. 

Enjoy!
